# **Runtime Setup**

## **1. Configuration (Required for all versions)**

Before running the application, you must configure your credentials.

1. Locate the file .env.example in the root directory.  
2. Rename it to .env.  
3. Open .env with a text editor and fill in the following values:  
   * `U_USERNAME`: Target platform username.  
   * `U_PASSWORD`: Target platform password.  
   * `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: Your API key (Apply at https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). **Note**: Minimum top-up is 1 CNY, which is more than enough for extensive use.

## **2. Launch Options**

Choose one of the following methods to run the application.

### **Option A: Portable Edition (Recommended)**

No installation required. Best for users without a pre-configured Python environment.

1. Download the **Portable** zip file from the release page.  
2. Extract the archive to a folder.  
3. Ensure your .env file is configured (see step 1).  
4. Run the `run.bat`.  
   **Note**: This version includes an embedded runtime and browser binary. No external downloads are required.

### **Option B: Lite / Source Edition**

For users with an existing Python environment.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Python**: Version **3.13** (Recommended) or 3.12.  
  * *Warning: Do not use Python 3.14+ (Dependencies incompatible).*  
  * Ensure **"Add Python to PATH"** is checked during installation.  
* **Git**: Required to clone the repository (or download Source Zip).

**Setup & Run:**

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/FlyingPig278/Unipus-AI-Automator-Refactored.git`  

2. Run the automated `run.bat`.  
   * The script will automatically:  
     * Create a virtual environment (.venv).  
     * Install/Update dependencies from the mirror.  
     * Download the required browser binary (Chromium).  
     * Launch the application.

## **Troubleshooting**

* **Browser Issues:** If the application fails to launch the browser, ensure you have a stable internet connection during the first run (Lite version only) to allow the binary download.  
* **API Errors:** Verify your key in the .env file is active and has sufficient balance.  
* **Path Errors:** Do not move the batch scripts out of the root directory.
